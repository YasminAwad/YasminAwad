Iâ€™m a computer science engineer who completed a Double Degree program at Politecnico di Milano (Italy) and Doshisha University (Japan) in April 2024.

ðŸŒ¼ After a year and a half of experience as a Full Stack AI Software Developer in Kyoto, Iâ€™m now back in Italy, enjoying the summer with the people I love most. Looking for new opportunities!

ðŸŒ· I canâ€™t wait to get back on track and see what the future holds! In the meantime, I keep diving into AI development and starting with web development â€” my new personal website is on its way!
