ðŸŒ¸ Iâ€™m a 27-year-old engineer who completed a Double Degree in Computer Science Engineering at Politecnico di Milano (Italy) and Doshisha University (Japan) in April 2024.


ðŸŒ¼ After a year and a half of experience as a Full Stack AI Software Developer in Kyoto, Iâ€™m now back in Italy, enjoying the summer with the people I love most.

ðŸŒ· I canâ€™t wait to get back on track and see what the future holds! In the meantime, Iâ€™m diving into web development â€” my new personal website is on its way!
